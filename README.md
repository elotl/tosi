# Tosi

Pull and extract container images. Tosi can pull images from image registries, and extract them to a flat directory, or create an [overlayfs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/overlayfs.txt) mount point with the layers as lowerdirs.

## Build

You can simply use:

    $ make

## Usage

To pull an image, and unpack all layers into `/tmp/nginx-rootfs`:

    tosi -image nginx -extractto /tmp/nginx-rootfs

Create an overlayfs mount in `/run/rootfs` from `quay.io/quay/redis`:

    tosi -image quay.io/quay/redis -mount /run/rootfs

Don't forget to unmount the overlayfs when done:

    umount /run/rootfs

Pull an image with a specific tag, without unpacking it, and save its config for inspection:

    tosi -image bitnami/tomcat:8.5.31 -saveconfig /tmp/tomcat.config

Pull a large image using 8 parallel threads for fetching layers:

    tosi -image quay.io/bitriseio/android-ndk -parallel-downloads 8

To use a cache directory at `/mnt/image-cache`:

    tosi -workdir /mnt/image-cache -image alpine

Tosi caches already downloaded layers, and can reuse layers for creating overlayfs mounts.

Check the speedup from caching layers:

    time tosi -workdir /mnt/image-cache -image ubuntu
    [...]
    real    0m10,693s
    user    0m1,416s
    sys     0m0,402s
    # Second time it should be a lot faster.
    time tosi -workdir /mnt/image-cache -image ubuntu
    [...]
    real    0m2,873s
    user    0m0,160s
    sys     0m0,055s

## How it works

Docker (and other modern container runtime, like containerd or CRI-O) containers are images with a writeable layer on top of one or more read-only layers. The read-only layers are created when an image is built, for example via `docker build`. The layers when saved are tarballs of all the files and directories created in a particular step of the image build. Images are stored on registry servers.

Tosi can fetch these layers and create a snapshot of all of them extracted or mounted via overlayfs into a directory, along with metadata, such as the image "config" (which provides overrideable defaults such as environment variables, entrypoint, etc) and the manifest describing the image.

If you look at the directories created by tosi:

    $ ls -1 /tmp/tosi
    configs/
    layers/
    manifests/
    overlays/

Here, "configs" contains the image configs, "manifests" the image manifests. The directory "layers" contains the layer tarballs, and finally, "overlays" contains directories with extracted layers.

For example, the image `alpine:3.6` has only one layer:

    {
       "schemaVersion": 2,
       "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json",
       "config": {
          "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.container.image.v1+json",
          "size": 1512,
          "digest": "sha256:43773d1dba76c4d537b494a8454558a41729b92aa2ad0feb23521c3e58cd0440"
       },
       "layers": [
          {
             "mediaType": "application/vnd.docker.image.rootfs.diff.tar.gzip",
             "size": 2017774,
             "digest": "sha256:5a3ea8efae5d0abb93d2a04be0a4870087042b8ecab8001f613cdc2a9440616a"
          }
       ]
    }

It is a tar.gz file:

    $ file /tmp/tosi/layers/5a3ea8efae5d0abb93d2a04be0a4870087042b8ecab8001f613cdc2a9440616a
    /tmp/tosi/layers/5a3ea8efae5d0abb93d2a04be0a4870087042b8ecab8001f613cdc2a9440616a: gzip compressed data, original size 4282880

You can check out the contents of the layer:

    $ ls -1 /tmp/tosi/overlays/5a3ea8efae5d0abb93d2a04be0a4870087042b8ecab8001f613cdc2a9440616a
    bin/
    dev/
    etc/
    home/
    lib/
    media/
    mnt/
    proc/
    root/
    run/
    sbin/
    srv/
    sys/
    tmp/
    usr/
    var/

Tosi also creates a short link, since overlayfs has a limit on the length of all the layer names when creating a mount. You can check the short link:

    $ cat /tmp/tosi/overlays/5a3ea8efae5d0abb93d2a04be0a4870087042b8ecab8001f613cdc2a9440616a.link
    1s8vir6felvja
    $ ls -l /tmp/tosi/overlays/1s8vir6felvja
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 64 mÃ¡j   19 10:04 /tmp/tosi/overlays/1s8vir6felvja -> 5a3ea8efae5d0abb93d2a04be0a4870087042b8ecab8001f613cdc2a9440616a/
    $ tosi -image alpine:3.6 -mount /tmp/alpine-rootfs
    [...]
    $ mount | grep alpine
    overlay on /tmp/alpine-rootfs type overlay (rw,relatime,lowerdir=1s8vir6felvja,upperdir=/tmp/alpine-rootfs.upper,workdir=/tmp/alpine-rootfs.work)
